How to further update the model annotations in a model:

o Insert our annotation snippet

o Edit the attributes in <model> element:
    <model metaid="WCM_3_3" id="WCM_3_3" name="Whole Cell 2015 - Cytokinesis">
    <model metaid="WCM_3_7" id="WCM_3_7" name="Whole Cell 2015 - FtsZ Polymerization">
  (for model ID: If you have more than one SBML files for one submodel, just append an dash followed by an counter.)


o Choose MAMO ids (from http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/MAMO/)

FtsZ Polymerization:
 Complex formation / Protein binding network -> to be created
 ODE model: http://identifiers.org/mamo/MAMO_0000046

Cytokinesis
 Complex formation / Protein binding network -> to be created
 Stochastic chemical reaction model
