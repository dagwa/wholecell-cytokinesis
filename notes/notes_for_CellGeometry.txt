What variables are written?

CellGeometry_width (written only upon initialization)
CellGeometry_pinchedDiameter (written only upon initialization)
CellGeometry_Volume
CellGeometry_septumLength
CellGeometry_cylindricalLength    
CellGeometry_surfaceArea

CellGeometry_chamberVolume        % unclear where this is used
CellGeometry_pinchedCircumference % unclear where it is computed and used

-------------------------------------------------------

mass = simulation.state('Mass'); %references to other parts of the cell state

density 
   % cell density in g/L % 1100 gram/l, according to supplement

volume % cell volume in L
   % read by Metabolism, ProteinActivation, ReplicationInitiation, and FtsZPolymerization
   volume = sum(mass.cell) / density;

width 
   % in m; width of the cell; stays constant across simulation; calculated during initialization  
   % initial width 200 nm?
     Initialization: width = 2 * (volume/1000 * 3/(4*pi))^(1/3);

pinchedDiameter  
   % m; diameter where cell is pinched the most
   % is only initialized here; further changes by submodel Cytokinesis
   Initialization: pinchedDiameter = width
   if pinchedDiameter <= 0,  ->  cell has divided; Cell shape is undefined

septumLength  
   % m
   septumLength = (width - pinchedDiameter) / 2;

cylindricalLength 
   % m; length of just the cylindrical part of the cell
   cylindricalLength = max(0, volume / 1000 - 1/6 * pi * width^3 - pi/2*(septumLength*(8*septumLength^2-4*septumLength*width+width^2) + 2 * septumLength^2 * (-2*septumLength+width)*pi/2 - 4/3*septumLength^3) ) * 4/(pi * width^2);

surfaceArea  
   % m^2; surface area of the cell
   surfaceArea = pi * width^2 + pi * width * cylindricalLength +  pi * 4 * septumLength * (width-2*septumLength+septumLength)

totalLength   
   % m; total cell length
   totalLength = cylindricalLength + width +  2 * septumLength

pinchedCircumference 
   % circumference where cell is pinched the most (in m)
   % unclear where it is computed

-------------------------------------------------------

pinched 
   % says whether cytokinesis is finished       
   % value is written in Cytokinesis model; not used here or anywhere else

chamberVolume        
   % volume of chamber in which cell is simulated (in L)
   % unclear where this is used
   chamberVolume = mass.cellInitialDryWeight / (1 - mass.fractionWetWeight) / mass.initialBiomassConcentration;
